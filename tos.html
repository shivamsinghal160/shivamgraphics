        <h4>Terms & Conditions</h4>
        The following Terms and Conditions of Service apply to all products and services provided by Shivam Graphics.

        All work is carried out by Glazier Design on the understanding that the client has agreed to our terms and

        If a choice of designs is presented and one is chosen for your project, only that solution is deemed to be given

        (50) percent of the project quotation total before the work commences or is supplied to the Client for review.
        The remaining fifty (50) percent of the project quotation total will be due upon completion of the work prior to
        upload to the server or release of materials.
        <h4>Charges for Other Services</h4>

        acceptance.
        <h4>Payment</h4>
        The customer will be provided with an Approval Form or Proof Email, and an Invoice prior to final publication.
        At this time the remainder of the amount due will become payable and the customer will also be required to sign
        and return the Approval Form or signify approval by email to Shivam Graphics.
